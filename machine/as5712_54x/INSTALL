Installing ONIE on KVM x86_64 Virtual Machine
=============================================

Cross-Compiling ONIE
====================

Change directories to ``build-config`` to compile ONIE.

To compile ONIE first change directories to ``build-config`` and then
type ``"make MACHINE=kvm_x86_64 all"``.  For example::

  $ cd build-config
  $ make -j4 MACHINE=kvm_x86_64 all

When complete, the ONIE binaries are located in
``build/images``::

-rw-r--r-- 1 3963992 Jan 30 16:38 kvm_x86_64-r0.initrd
-rw-r--r-- 1 3091328 Jan 30 10:58 kvm_x86_64-r0.vmlinuz
-rw-r--r-- 1 7067253 Jan 30 16:38 onie-updater-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0

kvm_x86_64-r0.vmlinuz -- This is the ONIE kernel image

kvm_x86_64-r0.initrd  -- This is the ONIE initramfs (filesystem)

onie-updater-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0 -- This is the ONIE self-update
image.  This image is a self-extracting archive used for installing
ONIE.

Creating an Empty x86_64 Virtual Machine
========================================

To create the VM:

1. Create a 150MB blank disk image to use as the "hard drive" for your VM.
   Name the file onie-x86-demo.img, putting it somewhere in your home
   directory::

     $ dd if=/dev/zero of=$HOME/kvm/onie-x86-demo.img bs=1M count=150

2. edit mk-vm.sh and set the DISK variable to point at the path you
   used in step 1.

3. run mk-mv.sh

This will create and launch a VM called "onie-x86-test".

Use virt-manager to connect to the VM console.

You can start/stop the VM using virsh::

  $ virsh start onie-x86-test
  $ virsh destroy onie-x86-test

Initially the VM is blank, the only software installed on the VM is
the BIOS and iPXE.

Installing the ONIE binaries into the Virtual Machine
=====================================================

This example assumes you have configured a DHCP server and a HTTP
server.  The DHCP server is nice to have, but not required.  The HTTP
server is required.

First copy the above build products to the root of your web server.
Here we assume the root of the web server is /var/www::

  $ cp kvm_x86_64-r0.vmlinuz kvm_x86_64-r0.initrd onie-updater-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0 /var/www

Next copy the provided ipxe installer script to the same directory::

  $ cp install.ipxe /var/www

.. note:: You will need to edit install.ipxe and change the
          onie-updater URL for your environment.  In the setting of
          the ``onie_url`` variable replace the string "<image-base>" with
          the IP address of your webserver.

When running under QEMU the virtual machine initially boots into
SeaBIOS, which has ipxe installed.  See http://www.ipxe.org/ for
complete details about ipxe.

1.  Before starting the virtual machine, connect to the console of the
    machine using virt-manager's VNC connection.

2.  Once installed, ONIE is configured to use the serial console of
    the VM.  It is nice to connect to that now, before installing
    ONIE, so you can see the difference between "before ONIE install"
    and "after ONIE install".  You can use the "virsh console" command
    to connect to the console::

      $ virsh console onie-x86-test

3.  Start the virtual machine using 'virsh start <machine-name>'

4.  On the console you wil see the SeaBIOS splash screen, followed by
    the ipxe splash screen.  Type <ctrl>-B now.

5.  That should drop you to iPXE prompt

6.  Configure the network interface.  This example assumes you have a
    DHCP server configured.  If not, use the ipxe ``config`` command
    to set up the network parameters.  At the ipxe prompt type::

    iPXE> dhcp

7.  Download and run the install.ipxe script.  The URL of the
    install.ipxe depends on your environment.  Use the IP address of
    your HTTP server::

    iPXE> chain http://<web-server-IP-address>/install.ipxe

The install.ipxe should now download and commence running.  The ipxe
script will do the following:

1.  Download kvm_x86_64-r0.vmlinuz

2.  Download kvm_x86_64-r0.initrd

3.  Boot into ONIE using the "ONIE update" mode, passing the URL of
    the ONIE self-update image in the ``install_url`` kernel command
    line arguemt.

Once ONIE has booted it will:

1.  Detect that it is running in "ONIE update" mode

2.  Find the ``install_url`` command line argument

3.  Proceed to perform the update using the
    onie-updater-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0 image.  This update procedure
    will install ONIE on the virtual hard drive.

Once the ONIE update is complete the machine reboots.  This time you
will see the GRUB menu and the machine will boot of the hard drive.
The default GRUB entry boots the machine into "ONIE install" mode.
